## Reflection
After a while into the project, I realized that the minimal API I used for the project where lacking in API calls, and the structure could use a big improvement to optimize the web application.
I could have gone back and changed a lot of structure but I did not, i wanted to learn how to handle the problems and what to think of next time I build a database.
The styling is still a work in progress
